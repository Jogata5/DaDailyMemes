Meme Sending Website
## Description
This website was built to allow users to create a profile and sign up to be sent random memes daily to help cheer them up and bring a laugh to them during the most stressful parts of the day. Memes are aimed to be sent around 3:00pm as the team deemed that to be one of the most tiring and stressful parts of a normal work week. It was designed using the Python language, specifically using the Django framework and hosted using Google Cloud server hosting. Currently, the webiste's function is not functioning properly but there is a meme tab on the website where thousands of memes will be cycled through just by refreshing the page.
